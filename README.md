## Semantic model
Plotting graphs we are trying to plot the trend of sentiments for each house in the book

We are plotting graphs for 2 categories of emotions
1) Looking at the trend of Houses in Harrypotter "Slytherin","Gryffindor","Hufflepuff","Ravenclaw" emotions Happy, Sad, Anger, Surprise, Fear
2) Looking the polarity and Subjectivity of the emotions

## Network Model 
Used Page Rank model to identify the sentences which provided the similar meaning. This model identified how differnet characters in the book went through the difficulties and hardhips.

## Computational model
Using Negative Binomial we try analyse how the most frequent words impact the emotion on the sentence.
As per the analysis, we see that the word "dumbledore" has a neural or positive sentiments whenever it used in a sentence.
